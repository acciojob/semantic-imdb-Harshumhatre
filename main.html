        <summary><strong>Vijay Salgaonkar :</strong> Every human has three kinds of worlds. One that's inside him. The
            second
            is the physical world. And the
            third which he creates himself, and can't live without. For me, my family is my world. I can do anything for
            them; go to any limits, whether someone calls me selfish or self-centered.</summary>
